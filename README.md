# Project Enigilo

Enigilo is a [Visual Studio Code][0] extension that's sole purpose is to make it easier to insert and manage your links in Markdown files.

## How to Use It

The simplest way to insert a link would be to select some text, right click, and then select `Insert Link`. It will show an **InputBox** so you can give it the URL of your link:

![Example-1][1]

As you can see in the gif, you can also use the default `Ctrl+Shift+I` keybinding, or even change it to whatever you prefer in [keybindings.json][5]:

![Keybindings.json][2]

As usual, any and all input is welcome and much appreciated ðŸ˜Š
